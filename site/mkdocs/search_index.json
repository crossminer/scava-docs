An API Gateway is a single point of entry (and control) for front end clients, which could be browser based or mobile. The client only has to know the URL of one server, and the backend can be refactored at will with no change.\n\n\nThe API Gateway act as a revers web proxy in which can be integrated others functions like load balancing and authentication. In case of the Scava platform, the  API Gateway will manage the authentication for all services of the platform.  \n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Mechanism\n\n\nJSON Web Tokens\n\n\nThe Scava API Gateway is secruized using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) mechanism, an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.\n\n\nIn authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned and must be saved locally, instead of the traditional approach of creating a session in the server and returning a cookie.When the client request an access to a protected service ,the server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header of the request, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. (More about JWT : https://jwt.io)\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Architecture\n\n\nIn Scava, the authentification service is a sub component of the Administration Application which centralise Right Management for the whole platform. As for the others services, the authentication service is accessed behind the API Gateway.\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Flow\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain an access to a specific service, the client must authenticate with the authentication service.If the authentication success,he recived a web token that should be include in the header of all of his future requests.\n\n\nWhen the client request a specific service, the api gateway valivate the token from the authentication  service. If the token is valide, the api gateway transmite the request to the related service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\nThe implementation of the gateway is based on Zuul proxy, a component of the spring-cloud project, an extention of the spring framework dedicated to microservices architectures.\n\n\nhttps://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud.html#_router_and_filter_zuul\n\n\nAPI Gateway Configuration\n\n\nThe Scava Gateway can be configured by the intermediary of an external property file (application.properties) to place in the execution directory of the Scava Gateway component. This file allow to configure the routing of requests send to the gateway an some security parameters.\n\n\nServer Configuration\n\n\n\n\nid : \nserver.port\ndefault :\n 8086\n\n\nPort of the CORSSMINER API server.

By default, there are three authorization levels which are predefined to get access to all the Scava's APIS, including:\n\n \u201cROLE_ADMIN\u201d\n\n \u201cROLE_PROJECT_MANAGER\u201d\n* \u201cROLE_USER\u201d\n\n\nBy the way, The frontend SCAVA administration comes with a default \u201cadmin\u201d who is mainly the admin user with all authorities access including \u201cROLE_ADMIN\u201d, \u201cROLE_PROJECT_MANAGER\u201d and \u201cROLE_USER\u201d authorizations.

In particular, Sec 2 presents an overview of the main development workflow by highlighting the main tools of the supporting development infrastructure. Section 3 mentions peculiar conventions that have to be adopted to write source code and to perform changes. Section 4 makes a list of tools supporting communication and collaboration among the different partners. Section 5 gives some important remarks related to the Scava project and its development.\n\n\nProcess overview\n\n\nThe development of the Scava components and of the integrated platform should follow the process shown in the following figure. Essentially, the development relies on the availability of a source code repository (to enable collaborative development) and of a Continuous Integration Server (to do the building and integration on behalf of the developers). Different deployment environments can be considered for deploying the built system.\n\n\nIt is important to remark that Continuous Integration (CI) requires that the different developers have self-testing code. This is code that tests itself to ensure that it is working as expected, and these tests are often called unit tests. When all the unit tests pass after the code is integrated, developers will get a green build. This indicates that they have verified that their changes are successfully integrated together, and the code is working as expected by the tests.\n\n\nThe different elements shown below are individually described in the remaining of the section.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Overview of the CROSSMINER development process and tools.\n\n\nSource Code Repository\n\n\nDifferent branches will be created in the repository. In particular, the \nmaster\n branch is the main branch and represents the released state of the product. It is always clean, builds and runs all the tests successfully. The \ndev\n branch contains the most recent code integrated by partners before release.\n\n\nOther branches will be created for the different features/components, which will be eventually merged in the \ndev\n branch. The name of each branch contains the id of the issue it is supposed to implement.\n\n\nAll source code, binary code and con\ufb01guration needed to build a working implementation of the system will reside in a GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\nCode: https://github.com/crossminer/scava\n\n\nProduct documentation: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-docs\n\n\nProduct deployment: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-deployment\n\n\n\n\nSince all source code will be stored in a single GitHub repository, each developer will have a working copy of the entire project. To simplify collaboration, each component will be contained in one subdirectory within the source structure (see Sec. 3 for details).\n\n\nBy taking inspiration from https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html the branching model that will be followed will resemble that shown in Fig. 2 without making use of the release and hotfixes branches. Details about the change conventions, pull requests, etc. are given in Sec. 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Branching model\n\n\nTests\n\n\nEach branch must have the corresponding unit tests. The dev branch must have integration tests and the unit tests of all the features that have been already merged as shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Explanatory master and branches\n\n\nBRANCH: Set of branches\nTEST: Set of tests\nINTGRATION_TEST < TEST\nUNIT_TEST < TEST\n\nfunction test: BRANCH -> TEST\n\ntest(master) -> test(cool-feature)\n    \u22c3 {itu, \u2026 itz}\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Integration Server\n\n\nContinuous integration (CI) involves integrating early and often, so as to avoid the pitfalls of \"integration hell\". The practice aims to reduce rework and thus \nreduce cost and time\n.\n\n\nA complementary practice to CI is that before submitting work, each programmer must do a complete build and run (and pass) all \nunit tests\n. \nIntegration tests\n are usually run automatically on a CI server when it detects a new commit. In particular, a CI server provides developers with at least the following functionalities:\n\n\n\n\nAllow developers to write unit tests that can be executed automatically\n\n\nPerform automated tests against newly written code\n\n\nShow a list of tests that have passed and failed\n\n\nQuality analysis on source code\n\n\nPerform all the necessary actions to create a fully functioning build of the software when all tests have passed\n\n\n\n\nThe currently used CI server is available at http://ci5.castalia.camp:8080/\n\n\nDevelopment and Production environments\n\n\nAccording to the DoW we have not promised the availability of a public installation of the CROSSMINER platform (i.e., a production environment). However, in order to implement the different use cases, use case partners are provided with docker images enabling the local installation of the whole CROSSMINER platform.\n\n\nNaming and change conventions\n\n\nThe repository will contain the code of the high-level components shown in Table 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nCorresponding folder in repository\n\n\nLeader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevOps Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nBIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow Diagram Editor\n\n\n/crossflow\n\n\nYORK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration Web Application\n\n\n/administration\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDE\n\n\n/eclipse-based-ide\n\n\nFEA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Gateway\n\n\n/api-gateway\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevOps Backend\n\n\n\n\nBIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Base\n\n\n/knowledge-base\n\n\nUDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Analyser\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collector\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Scheduler\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric Providers\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nYORK, CWI, AUEB, EHU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Storage\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb-based dashboards\n\n\n/web-dashboards\n\n\nBIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Leaders and Contributors of the CROSSMINER Deployment diagram nodes\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Scava components architecture\n\n\nFor each component a corresponding folder is available in the repository. Changes must have a CR (i.e. issue) entry for traceability. In particular, the requirements and objectives of each Scava components will be detailed in the relevant deliverables and they will be added in the form of items in the provided Bug Tracking infrastructure. In this way progress on the implementation of each requirement can be tracked. Thus:\n\n\n\n\nwhen developers want to operate changes they have to create corresponding issues in the bug tracking system for traceability reasons;\n\n\nwhen a developer wants to perform changes on a component led by an organization, which is different than that the developer belongs to, a pull request (PR) has to be done. Such a PR will be managed by one of the members of the organization leading the component affected by the changes in the PR.\n\n\n\n\nThe partner in charge of managing the development of a component will be free to organize the content of the corresponding subdirectory in any way as long as the following standard \ufb01les/directories are contained in the component folder:\n\n\n\n\nreadme.md\n : this \ufb01le will contain the entry-point to all documentation for the component.\n\n\nJenkinsfile\n: in order to compile the component, run tests, etc on the CI server.\n\n\ntest\n: this is a folder containing the unit and/or integration tests.\n\n\n\n\nAs a reference, please have a look at https://github.com/crossminer/scava/tree/master/knowledge-base\n\n\nThe following items are typical practices when applying CI:\n\n Maintain a code repository\n\n Automate the build\n\n Make the build self-testing\n\n Everyone commits to the baseline every day\n\n Every commit (to baseline) should be built\n\n Keep the build fast\n\n Test in a clone of the production environment\n\n Make it easy to get the latest deliverables\n\n Everyone can see the results of the latest build\n\n Automate deployment\n\n\nCommunication and collaboration means\n\n\nThe development activities can be done by exploiting different communication and collaboration means. In particular, currently the consortium members have the availability of:\n\n\n\n\nSlack channel: http://crossminer.slack.com\n\n\nEclipse Mailing lists: https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/scava-dev\n\n\nGitHub repository for documentation: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-docs/",

A complementary practice to CI is that before submitting work, each programmer must do a complete build and run (and pass) all  unit tests .  Integration tests  are usually run automatically on a CI server when it detects a new commit. In particular, a CI server provides developers with at least the following functionalities:   Allow developers to write unit tests that can be executed automatically  Perform automated tests against newly written code  Show a list of tests that have passed and failed  Quality analysis on source code  Perform all the necessary actions to create a fully functioning build of the software when all tests have passed   The currently used CI server is available at http://ci5.castalia.camp:8080/",

Changes must have a CR (i.e. issue) entry for traceability. In particular, the requirements and objectives of each Scava components will be detailed in the relevant deliverables and they will be added in the form of items in the provided Bug Tracking infrastructure. In this way progress on the implementation of each requirement can be tracked. Thus:   when developers want to operate changes they have to create corresponding issues in the bug tracking system for traceability reasons;  when a developer wants to perform changes on a component led by an organization, which is different than that the developer belongs to, a pull request (PR) has to be done. Such a PR will be managed by one of the members of the organization leading the component affected by the changes in the PR.   The partner in charge of managing the development of a component will be free to organize the content of the corresponding subdirectory in any way as long as the following standard \ufb01les/directories are contained in the component folder:   readme.md  : this \ufb01le will contain the entry-point to all documentation for the component.  Jenkinsfile : in order to compile the component, run tests, etc on the CI server.  test : this is a folder containing the unit and/or integration tests.   As a reference, please have a look at https://github.com/crossminer/scava/tree/master/knowledge-base  The following items are typical practices when applying CI:  Maintain a code repository  Automate the build  Make the build self-testing  Everyone commits to the baseline every day  Every commit (to baseline) should be built  Keep the build fast  Test in a clone of the production environment  Make it easy to get the latest deliverables  Everyone can see the results of the latest build  Automate deployment",

This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents.

As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\n\n\n\nSource File header\n\n\nAll sources files of each Scava component projects must have a license Header.

I've created an OpenAPI specification and then built it with the generator. You will see a minimalistic configuration: it contains a single path specification, which requires one number input parameter and then gives back the parameters square. The number input parameter is provided via the path, so it looks like the following: \n/square/{number}\n. You can replace the \n{number}\n with any number. The repsonse for this request is a \nJSON\n object, which looks like this:\n\n\n{\n    \"squared\": {squaredValue}\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt contains only one field, named \nsquared\n, which has the value of the square of the given number. From the specification the generator will provide us a \nJava Project\n which will implement the use of the specified API. It will provide us an interface to easily access the functionalities of the API. To use this interface, after the import of the proper dependencies, we only need to write a few lines:\n\n\nITestAPIApi api = TestAPIApi.createDefault(); //create an instance of the api interface (with default settings).\nint number = 7; //The number to be squared.\nIData<NumberValue> squared = api.getSquareNumberValueByNumber(number); //the actual use of the API descibed in the specification. It sends a request to the server.\nNumberValue numberValue; //NumberValue is the class which represents the object received from the server\nnumberValue = squared.observe().blockingSingle(); //Get the actually received object from the response.\nSystem.out.println(\"Squared:\" + numberValue.getSquared()); //Print the received answer.\n\n\n\n\nEverything, including the \nIEntityApi\n interface and the \nNumberValue\n class is generated by the generator. The former is a complete set of the functions provided by the API and the latter is an example of the container classes, which has the purpose of letting access through \nJava\n to the objects/field inside of the received \nJSON\n object. And once again, they are all generated from the OpenAPI specification.\n\n\nSo, to generate the mentioned \nJava Project\n, you have to put your OpenAPI specification file into the \nschemas\n folder inside the \norg.eclipse.crossmeter.workflow.restmule.generator\n project. I'll call mine as \nTestAPI.json\n, and it's made up of the following:\n\n\n{\n  \"swagger\": \"2.0\",\n  \"schemes\": [\n    \"http\"\n  ],\n  \"host\": \"localhost:8080\",\n  \"basePath\": \"/\",\n  \"info\": {\n    \"description\": \"This is a test API, only for demonstration of the generator.\",\n    \"termsOfService\": \"\",\n    \"title\": \"TestAPI\",\n    \"version\": \"v1\"\n  },\n  \"consumes\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"produces\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"securityDefinitions\": {\n\n  },\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/square/{number}\": {\n      \"get\": {\n        \"description\": \"Square a number.\",\n        \"parameters\": [\n          {\n            \"description\": \"The number to be squared\",\n            \"in\": \"path\",\n            \"name\": \"number\",\n            \"required\": true,\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"OK\",\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/NumberValue\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"definitions\": {\n    \"NumberValue\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"squared\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"type\": \"object\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can see here the path and the NumberValue object. They are well specified in this file, so the generator can create our project by on its own.\nThen we have to set the generator to use our new schema. To do this, open the \nbuild.xml\n in the generator project and modify the \napi\n and \njson.model.file\n property to \ntestapi\n and \nschemas/TestAPI.json\n, respectively.\n\n\n<!--API Variables -->\n<property name=\"api\" value=\"testapi\" />\n<property name=\"json.model.file\" value=\"schemas/TestAPI.json\" />\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost done, but we have to take one more small step.

            "text": "I've made a simple example for the generator. I've created an OpenAPI specification and then built it with the generator. You will see a minimalistic configuration: it contains a single path specification, which requires one number input parameter and then gives back the parameters square. The number input parameter is provided via the path, so it looks like the following:  /square/{number} . You can replace the  {number}  with any number. The repsonse for this request is a  JSON  object, which looks like this:  {\n    \"squared\": {squaredValue}\n}  It contains only one field, named  squared , which has the value of the square of the given number. From the specification the generator will provide us a  Java Project  which will implement the use of the specified API. It will provide us an interface to easily access the functionalities of the API. To use this interface, after the import of the proper dependencies, we only need to write a few lines:  ITestAPIApi api = TestAPIApi.createDefault(); //create an instance of the api interface (with default settings).\nint number = 7; //The number to be squared.\nIData<NumberValue> squared = api.getSquareNumberValueByNumber(number); //the actual use of the API descibed in the specification. It sends a request to the server.\nNumberValue numberValue; //NumberValue is the class which represents the object received from the server\nnumberValue = squared.observe().blockingSingle(); //Get the actually received object from the response.\nSystem.out.println(\"Squared:\" + numberValue.getSquared()); //Print the received answer.  Everything, including the  IEntityApi  interface and the  NumberValue  class is generated by the generator. The former is a complete set of the functions provided by the API and the latter is an example of the container classes, which has the purpose of letting access through  Java  to the objects/field inside of the received  JSON  object. And once again, they are all generated from the OpenAPI specification.  So, to generate the mentioned  Java Project , you have to put your OpenAPI specification file into the  schemas  folder inside the  org.eclipse.crossmeter.workflow.restmule.generator  project. I'll call mine as  TestAPI.json , and it's made up of the following:  {\n  \"swagger\": \"2.0\",\n  \"schemes\": [\n    \"http\"\n  ],\n  \"host\": \"localhost:8080\",\n  \"basePath\": \"/\",\n  \"info\": {\n    \"description\": \"This is a test API, only for demonstration of the generator.\",\n    \"termsOfService\": \"\",\n    \"title\": \"TestAPI\",\n    \"version\": \"v1\"\n  },\n  \"consumes\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"produces\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"securityDefinitions\": {\n\n  },\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/square/{number}\": {\n      \"get\": {\n        \"description\": \"Square a number.\",\n        \"parameters\": [\n          {\n            \"description\": \"The number to be squared\",\n            \"in\": \"path\",\n            \"name\": \"number\",\n            \"required\": true,\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"OK\",\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/NumberValue\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"definitions\": {\n    \"NumberValue\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"squared\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"type\": \"object\"\n    }\n  }\n}  You can see here the path and the NumberValue object. They are well specified in this file, so the generator can create our project by on its own.\nThen we have to set the generator to use our new schema. To do this, open the  build.xml  in the generator project and modify the  api  and  json.model.file  property to  testapi  and  schemas/TestAPI.json , respectively.  <!--API Variables -->\n<property name=\"api\" value=\"testapi\" />\n<property name=\"json.model.file\" value=\"schemas/TestAPI.json\" />  We are almost done, but we have to take one more small step. We have to provide an  .eol  file in the  epsilon/util/fix/  folder in the generator project. Its name must be the same as the value of the  api  property in the previous step, so for this example we use the  testapi.eol .

In order to avoid to multiply the number of deployed web servers, we plan to centralize all REST service implementation in the same plug-in.\n\n\nYou want to access to create a new REST Service ?\n\n\n1. Create a new Route\n\n\nTo  register a new RESTLET service, the first step is to define the route (base url which allow to access to this service) and make the link between this route an the implementation of the service.\n\n\nNaming the Route\n\n\nThe routes (Base URL) of services provided by the platform is normalize. Please refer to this guideline to know ho to define the route of the new service : \nNaming-Scava-REST-Services.html\n\n\nRegister the Route\n\n\nThe \norg.scava.platform.services\n plug-in contained the class \nPlatformRoute.java\n  responsible for declaring routes.\n\n\npackage org.scava.platform.services;\nimport org.restlet.Application;\nimport org.restlet.Restlet;\nimport org.restlet.routing.Router;\n\npublic class PlatformRoute extends Application {\n    @Override\n    public Restlet createInboundRoot() {\n        Router router = new Router(getContext());\n\n        router.attach(\"/\", PingResource.class);     \n        router.attach(\"/search\", SearchProjectResource.class);\n                ...\n                router.attach(\"/projects/p/{projectid}\", ProjectResource.class);\n        router.attach(\"/raw/metrics\", RawMetricListResource.class);\n        ...\n        return router;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nRoute Example :\n\n\nrouter.attach(\"/raw/metrics\", RawMetricListResource.class);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"/raw/metrics\"\n: Represent the route URL.\n\n\n\"RawMetricListResource.class\"\n : Represent the class where the service to be implemented for this path.\n\n\n\n\nA route can contained some parameters. In this case, parameters are identified by a name with curly brackets \n{}\n.\n\n\n2. Implement the Service\n\n\nA service implementation is a Java class which extend the \nServerResource\n class provided by the RESTLET framework.\nTo create a new service create a new Class :\n\n Named \"\nServiceName\n\" + Resource.  Ex : ProjectCreationResource.java\n\n On a namespace based on the  route. Ex : org.scava.platform.services.administration for platform administration services.\n* Who extend the org.restlet.resource.ServerResource class.\n\n\nGET Service\n\n\nTo implement a service of type GET, create a new method :\n\n Based on the following signature : public final Representation represent()\n\n Add the @Get(\"json\") annotation\n\n\n\n@Get(\"json\")\npublic final Representation represent() {\n  // Initialise Response Header\n  Series<Header> responseHeaders = (Series<Header>) getResponse().getAttributes().get(\"org.restlet.http.headers\");\n   if (responseHeaders == null) {\n    responseHeaders = new Series(Header.class);\n     getResponse().getAttributes().put(\"org.restlet.http.headers\", responseHeaders);\n  }\n  responseHeaders.add(new Header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\"));\n  responseHeaders.add(new Header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"GET\"));\n\n  // Get Route parameter if required {projectid}\n  String projectId = (String) getRequest().getAttributes().get(\"projectid\");\n\n\n  try {\n    ....\n    // Provide Result\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.SUCCESS_OK);\n    return new StringRepresentation(...);\n  } catch (IOException e) {\n    StringRepresentation rep = new StringRepresentation(\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\", \\\"message\\\" : \\\"\"+e.getMessage()+\"\\\"}\");\n    rep.setMediaType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.CLIENT_ERROR_BAD_REQUEST);\n    return rep;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also extend the \nAbstractApiResource\n , a service class  provided by the platform and dedicate to services who request a connection to MongoDb database instead of the \nServerResource\n. In this case you will have to implement the doRepresent() method.\n\n\npublic class RawMetricListResource extends AbstractApiResource {\n    public Representation doRepresent() {\n        ObjectNode res = mapper.createObjectNode();\n\n        ArrayNode metrics = mapper.createArrayNode();\n        res.put(\"metrics\", metrics);\n        ...\n        return Util.createJsonRepresentation(res);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nPOST Service\n\n\nTo implement a service of type POST, crate a new method :\n\n Based on the following signature : public Representation \nmyServiceName\n (Representation entity)\n\n Add the @Post annotation\n\n\n@Post\npublic Representation myServiceName(Representation entity) {\n  try {\n    // Read Json Datas\n    JsonNode json = mapper.readTree(entity.getText());\n\n    ...\n\n    // Provide Result\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.SUCCESS_CREATED);\n    return new StringRepresentation(...);\n\n  } catch (IOException e) {\n    StringRepresentation rep = new StringRepresentation(\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\", \\\"message\\\" : \\\"\"+e.getMessage()+\"\\\"}\");\n    rep.setMediaType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.CLIENT_ERROR_BAD_REQUEST);\n   return rep;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDELETE Service\n\n\nTo do ....\n\n\n3. Document the Service\n\n\nThe REST services are the main integration points between platform components or between the platform and external clients. This services are the implementation of a contract between the service provider and his consumers. In order to  allow an easy integration, this contract must be documented :",

The second, a \nhistorical\n metric provider, will count the total number of commits over time. \n\n\nWe'll go through the steps above for each metric provider.\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\n\n\nEclipse \n\n\nThe \nEmfatic\n plug-in should be installed in your Eclipse\n\n\nThe \nPongo\n plug-in should be installed in your Eclipse\n\n\nThe OSSMETER source code should be in your workspace\n\n\n\n\nThe Transient Metric Provider\n\n\nThis metric provider will store a complete history of the commits in the version control system(s) used by a project. \n\n\n0. Setup\n\n\nCreate a new Plugin project in Eclipse.\n\n\n\n\nGo to File > New > Project... and select 'Plug-in project'\n\n\nGive the project an appropriate name. The OSSMETER naming convention is:\n\n\nTransient metrics: org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.(metric name)\n\n\nHistorical metrics: org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historical.(metric name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Next\n\n\nIf the \"This plug-in will make contributions to the UI\" checkbox is ticked, uncheck it\n\n\nClick Finish\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file in your new project. Open the 'Dependencies' tab and add 'com.googlecode.pongo.runtime', 'org.ossmeter.platform', and 'org.ossmeter.repository.model' to the dependency list.\n\n\n\n\n1. The data model\n\n\nWe define the data model using the Emfatic language. In your newly created plug-in, create a package called \norg.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.model\n. In that package create an empty file called \ncommits.emf\n. In this file, we will define our data model.\n\n\nFirst of all, we need to state the name of the package.\n\n\npackage org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.model;\n\n\n\n\nThis is used by the Pongo code generator - the generated classes will be put in this package.\n\n\nWe then define the database for our model:\n\n\n@db(qualifiedCollectionNames=\"true\")\nclass Commits {\n    val Repository[*] repositories;\n    val Commit[*] commits;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \n@db\n annotation tells Pongo that this will be the container database for the data. Adding the \nqualifiedCollectionNames=true\n property will prepend the database name to all Mongo collections. \n\n\nThe \nCommits\n class above says that we want a database with two collections, name \nrepositories\n and \ncommits\n. If \nqualifiedCollectionNames\n is set to \ntrue\n, the collections will be named \nCommits.repositories\n and \nCommits.commits\n. \n\n\nWe now define the schema of the \nCommits.repositories\n collection:\n\n\n~~~java\nclass Repository {\n    @searchable\n    attr String url;\n    attr String repoType;\n    attr String revision;\n    attr int totalNumberOfCommits;\n    ref CommitData[*] commits;\n}\n\n\n\nThis class is used to store information related to the commits in the project's VCS repositories. The collection will contain one entry per VCS repository. Repositories are identified by a `url`, and also have a `repoType` (e.g. Git or SVN), the latest `revision`, the `totalNumberOfCommits`, and a reference to all of the `commits` in the repository, which are stored in the `Commits.commits` collection.\n\nThe `@searchable` annotation will make Pongo generate two utility search methods on the collection: `findByUrl(String url) : Iterable<Repository>` and `findOneByUrl(String url) : Repository`. An index will also be create on this field to improve look up time.\n\nEach commit is represented in the `Commits.commits` collection by the following model:\n\n~~~~java\nclass Commit {\n    @searchable\n    attr Date date;\n    attr String identifier;\n    attr String message;\n    attr String author;\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor each commit, we store its \ndate\n, \nidentifier\n (revision ID), the commit \nmessage\n, and the \nauthor\n. We also create an index on the \ndate\n to allow us to quickly discover the set of commits that occurred on a given date (using the autogenerated \nfindByDate(String date)\n or \nfindOneByDate(String date)\n methods).\n\n\nNow we need to use Pongo to generate code from this model. Right-click on the \ncommits.emf\n file and select \nPongo > Generate Pongos and plugin.xml\n. You should see some Java classes appear in your package.\n\n\nNow that we have our data model, we can implement the metric provider.\n\n\n2. The metric provider\n\n\nCreate a Java class called \norg.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.CommitsTransientMetricProvider\n\n\nThis class should extend \nAbstractTransientMetricProvider\n and specify \nCommits\n for the generic argument:\n\n\npublic class org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.CommitsTransientMetricProvider extends AbstractTransientMetricProvider<Commits>\n\n\n\n\nThe generic argument states that the metric provider stores objects conforming to the \nCommits\n data model. Note: You do not need to extend \nAbstractTransientMetricProvider\n and can implement \nITransientMetricProvider\n instead should you wish to.\n\n\nThere are a number of methods that need implementing. We will discuss each in turn.\n\n\nadapt(DB db)\n\n\nThis method returns the Pongo database that the metric provider will use to store its data. This is boilerplate, unfortunately, we can't auto-generate it. Implement as follows:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public Commits adapt(DB db) {\n        return new Commits(db);\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing we want to do is fill in useful information that helps users understand the purpose of the metric provider:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public String getShortIdentifier() { // This may be deprecated very soon\n        return \"transient-commits\"; \n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getFriendlyName() {\n        return \"Commit History\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getSummaryInformation() {\n        return \"The commit history of the project.\";\n    }\n\n\n\n\nThe next method allows you to declare whether the metric provider is applicable to a given project:\n\n\n@Override\n    public boolean appliesTo(Project project) {\n        return project.getVcsRepositories().size() > 0;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nOur metric applies to any project that has at least one VCS repository.\n\n\nFinally, we have the \nmeasure(...)\n method that performs the actual metric calculation:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void measure(Project project, ProjectDelta delta, Commits db) {\n\n        for (VcsRepositoryDelta repoDelta : delta.getVcsDelta().getRepoDeltas()) {\n            Repository repo = db.getRepositories().findOneByUrl(repoDelta.getRepository().getUrl());\n\n            if (repo == null) {\n                repo = new Repository();\n                repo.setUrl(repoDelta.getRepository().getUrl());\n                db.getRepositories().add(repo);\n            }\n\n            for (VcsCommit commit : repoDelta.getCommits()) {\n                Commit c = new Commit();\n                c.setDate(commit.getJavaDate());\n                c.setMessage(commit.getMessage());\n                c.setAuthor(commit.getAuthor());\n                c.setIdentifier(commit.getRevision());\n\n                repo.getCommits().add(c);\n                db.getCommits().add(c);\n            }\n        }\n        db.getCommits().sync();\n        db.getRepositories().sync();\n    }\n\n\n\n\nThe above method iterates through the delta computed by the platform. The delta consists of the commits that occurred in each of the project's VCS repositories for the date being analysed. A new \nCommit\n object is created for each commit in the delta.\n\n\n3. Make the metric provider discoverable\n\n\nMetric providers are registered with the OSSMETER platform using \nextension points\n:\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file and select the 'Extensions' tab\n\n\nClick the Add button and from the list select \norg.ossmeter.platform.metricprovider\n\n\nOn the right hand side of the editor, you will now see a text box with the label 'provider' and a 'Browse...' button.\n\n\nClick the 'Browse...' button and select the 'CommitsTransientMetricProvider' class\n\n\n\n\nNow everything is ready for the metric to be executed :)\n\n\nThe Historic Metric Provider\n\n\nThis metric provider will keep track of the total number of commits of the project over time. For each date of the project, the metric counts how many commits have been made and stores the value.  \n\n\n0. Setup\n\n\nCreate a new Plugin project in Eclipse.  \n\n\n\n\nGo to File > New > Project... and select 'Plug-in project'\n\n\nGive the project an appropriate name. The OSSMETER naming convention is:\n\n\nTransient metrics: org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.(metric name)\n\n\nHistorical metrics: org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historical.(metric name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Next\n\n\nIf the \"This plug-in will make contributions to the UI\" checkbox is ticked, uncheck it\n\n\nClick Finish\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file in your new project. Open the 'Dependencies' tab and add 'com.googlecode.pongo.runtime', 'org.ossmeter.platform', and 'org.ossmeter.repository.model' to the dependency list.\n\n\n\n\n1. The data model\n\n\nIn your newly created plug-in, create a package called org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.model. In that package create an empty file called historiccommits.emf. In this file, we will define our data model:\n\n\npackage org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.model;\n\nclass HistoricCommits {\n    attr int numberOfCommits;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe data model for the historic metric is much simpler. No Pongo annotations are used because, unlike transient metrics, the platform is responsible for storing the historic data. The data model defined here will be stored against the date that the analysis is performed.\n\n\n2. The metric provider\n\n\nCreate a Java class called org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historical.commits.CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider\n\n\nThis class should extend AbstractHistoricalMetricProvider (there are no generic arguments (yet!)):\n\n\npublic class org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.CommitsTransientMetricProvider extends AbstractTransientMetricProvider\n\nThe generic argument states that the metric provider stores objects conforming to the Commits data model. Note: You do not need to extend AbstractTransientMetricProvider and can implement ITransientMetricProvider instead should you wish to.\n\n\nThere are a number of methods that need implementing. We will discuss each in turn.\n\n\nFirst of all, complete the typical information-related methods:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public String getShortIdentifier() {\n        return \"historicalcommits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getFriendlyName() {\n        return \"Historical commits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getSummaryInformation() {\n        return \"...\";\n    }\n\n\n\n\nNow complete the standard \nappliesTo\n method:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean appliesTo(Project project) {\n        return project.getVcsRepositories().size() > 0;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to specify a dependency on the transient metric provider that we just implemented.\n\n\n    @Override\n    public List<String> getIdentifiersOfUses() {\n        return Arrays.asList(CommitsTransientMetricProvider.class.getCanonicalName());\n    }   \n\n\n\n\nThis tells the platform that we need access to the \nCommitsTransientMetricProvider\n database. The platform will assign this to the \nuses\n field that is available to the historical metric provider, as you'll see in the \nmeasure\n method:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public Pongo measure(Project project) {\n        Commits transDb = (Commits) getDbOfMetricProvider(project, (ITransientMetricProvider) uses.get(0));\n\n        int commits = (int) transDb.getCommits().size();\n\n        HistoricCommits hist = new HistoricCommits();\n        hist.setNumberOfCommits(commits);\n\n        return hist;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we get hold of the database of the transient commits metric provider, and simply count the size of the \ncommits\n collection. We save this in an instance of the \nHistoricCommits\n Pongo defined above. This object is returned by the method and the platform stores it in the database along with the date that is currently being analysed for the project.\n\n\n3. Make the metric provider discoverable\n\n\nThis process is the same as the transient metric provider:\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file and select the 'Extensions' tab\n\n\nClick the Add button and from the list select \norg.ossmeter.platform.metricprovider\n\n\nOn the right hand side of the editor, you will now see a text box with the label 'provider' and a 'Browse...' button.\n\n\nClick the 'Browse...' button and select the 'CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider' class\n\n\n\n\nNow everything is ready for both metrics to be executed :)\n\n\nBut first. Let's specify how we want this historical metric to be visualised.\n\n\n4. Define a MetVis visualisation specification\n\n\nMetVis\n is a JSON-based specification language and visualisation engine for metrics. You specify how the Pongo data model should be transformed into something that can be plotted on a chart. The MetVis \nweb page\n has numerous examples of this.\n\n\nCreate a folder in your historical metric project called 'vis'. In the 'vis' folder create a file called 'historicalcommits.json'. Here is the MetVis specification for the historical commits metric provider:\n\n\n{\n    \"metricid\" : \"org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider\",\n    \"vis\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"historicalcommits\",\n            \"name\" : \"Commits over time\",\n            \"description\" : \"This metric shows when the projects commits occurred\",\n            \"type\" : \"LineChart\",\n            \"datatable\" : {\n                \"cols\" : [\n                    { \"name\" : \"Date\", \"field\" : \"$__date\" },\n                    { \"name\" : \"Commits\", \"field\" : \"$numberOfCommits\" }\n                ]\n            },\n            \"x\" : \"Date\",\n            \"y\" : \"Commits\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmetricId\n field tells the platform which metric provider the specification visualises. A metric provider can have multiple visualisations. In this case, we just define one, which plots the date on the X-axis and the number of commits on the Y-axis. Fields in the Pongo data model are references using the $-sign. To access the date field of a historical metric, use \n$__date\n. The final two fields (\nx\n and \ny\n) are references to column names in the datatable specification. The \ntype\n states that the data should be plotted as a line chart. You can test your MetVis specifications on the \nMetVis playpen\n.\n\n\n5. Make the visualisation specification discoverable\n\n\nAs with metric providers, visualisation specifications are registered using extension points.\n\n\n\n\nAdd the 'org.ossmeter.platform.visualisation' plugin as a dependency on your project\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file and select the 'Extensions' tab\n\n\nClick the Add button and from the list select \norg.ossmeter.platform.visualisation.metric\n\n\nOn the right hand side of the editor, you will now see a text box with the label 'provider' and a 'Browse...' button.\n\n\nClick the 'Browse...' button and select the 'historicalcommits.json' file\n\n\n\n\nGood job.\n\n\nRunning the metric providers\n\n\nSee \nRunning from Source\n\n\nHomework\n\n\nAdapt the historical commits metric provider so that it stores the commits for each repository separately (in the above, it sums them all up). Write the MetVis specification - each series should be the commits for separate repositories.",

Note: You do not need to extend AbstractTransientMetricProvider and can implement ITransientMetricProvider instead should you wish to.  There are a number of methods that need implementing. We will discuss each in turn.  First of all, complete the typical information-related methods:      @Override\n    public String getShortIdentifier() {\n        return \"historicalcommits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getFriendlyName() {\n        return \"Historical commits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getSummaryInformation() {\n        return \"...\";\n    }  Now complete the standard  appliesTo  method:      @Override\n    public boolean appliesTo(Project project) {\n        return project.getVcsRepositories().size() > 0;\n    }  We now need to specify a dependency on the transient metric provider that we just implemented.      @Override\n    public List<String> getIdentifiersOfUses() {\n        return Arrays.asList(CommitsTransientMetricProvider.class.getCanonicalName());\n    }     This tells the platform that we need access to the  CommitsTransientMetricProvider  database.

You specify how the Pongo data model should be transformed into something that can be plotted on a chart. The MetVis  web page  has numerous examples of this.  Create a folder in your historical metric project called 'vis'. In the 'vis' folder create a file called 'historicalcommits.json'. Here is the MetVis specification for the historical commits metric provider:  {\n    \"metricid\" : \"org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider\",\n    \"vis\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"historicalcommits\",\n            \"name\" : \"Commits over time\",\n            \"description\" : \"This metric shows when the projects commits occurred\",\n            \"type\" : \"LineChart\",\n            \"datatable\" : {\n                \"cols\" : [\n                    { \"name\" : \"Date\", \"field\" : \"$__date\" },\n                    { \"name\" : \"Commits\", \"field\" : \"$numberOfCommits\" }\n                ]\n            },\n            \"x\" : \"Date\",\n            \"y\" : \"Commits\"\n        }\n    ]\n}  The  metricId  field tells the platform which metric provider the specification visualises. A metric provider can have multiple visualisations. In this case, we just define one, which plots the date on the X-axis and the number of commits on the Y-axis. Fields in the Pongo data model are references using the $-sign. To access the date field of a historical metric, use  $__date . The final two fields ( x  and  y ) are references to column names in the datatable specification. The  type  states that the data should be plotted as a line chart.

This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5.

This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5.

GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance.

Note that the Kibiter dashboard is on port 80 by default.\n\n\nUpdate the \nALLOWED_HOST\ndirective to include the host name on service \nprosoul\n. This is used by Django on the prosoul image to publish the quality model used by Crossminer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the Docker images\n\n\nThe deployment setup is hosted in the \nscava-deployment\n repository. One needs to clone the repository locally in order to build and run the docker images.\n\n\nTo build all the required Docker images, simply go to the root of the cloned repository and issue the following command. This will rebuild all images, dismissing any cached layers.\n\n\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build --no-cache\n\n\n\n\nThis will build required images using the latest version of the binaries on the CI server and pull images hosted on docker hub.\n\n\nSetup Configurations\n\n\nSome optional configurations can be made to customize the dockerized SCAVA instance. These configuration are applied to the docker-compose description files \ndocker-compose-build.yml\n or \ndocker-compose-dockerhub.yml\n and are applied every time that the instance runs.\n\n\nData persistence\n\n\nVolumes can be created to persist the data of the databases between execution of the Scava platform. To enable the creation of volumes uncomemnt the corresponding lines on the \noss-db\n and \nkb-db\n services:\n\n\n\n\nOn \noss-db\n:\n\n\n\n\n    volumes: #creates volume on container\n        - ~/oss-data:/data/db\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \nkb-db\n:\n\n\n\n\n    volumes: #creates volume on container\n        - ~/kb-data:/data/kb-db\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Workers Configuration\n\n\nOne instance of the metric-platform is only able to run one worker. Therefore, a setup where it is required to have more than one worker requires the deployment of multiple instances of metric platform.\n\n\nThe main instance of the metric platform runs under the service \noss-app\n. This is the service started by default with the \nmaster\n and \napiServer\n flags, and launchs the worker \nw1\n.\n\n\nTo enable a second worker, the \ndocker-compose-build.yml\n (or \ndocker-compose-dockerhub.yml\n) file must be edited and uncomented the service \noss-slave\n. This service will launch a new instance of the metric platform that will only run one worker (with default name \nw2\n). This slave instance \ndo not have\n the flags \nmaster\n or \napiServer\n.\n\n\nNew slaves can be added (e.g. \noss-slave01\n,\noss-slave02\n,\noss-slave03\n, etc.) by copy-paste of the \noss-slave\n service and changing the name of service and name of the worker.\n\n\nRunning the locally built docker images\n\n\nTo run the locally built images, run the following command. Note that if the images are not available they will be rebuilt.\n\n\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml up\n\n\n\n\nAccess the administration web app by using the following address in the web browser: http://admin-webapp/\nFor login use user: admin  pass: admin\n\n\nRunning the pre-built docker images\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the docker hub images are not yet ready! We're working on it! :-)\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to run the full Scava setup is to use the docker images \nstored on Docker Hub\n. Use the \ndocker-compose-dockerhub.yml\n file to download all required images and start the stack:\n\n\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dockerhub.yml up\n\n\n\n\nAccess the administration web app by using the following address in the web browser: http://admin-webapp/\n\n\nFor login use user: admin  pass: admin\n\n\nPost-install tasks\n\n\nConfiguring the GitHub token\n\n\nIn order to use the GitHub connectors, one needs to setup an authentication mechanism. Simply create a authentication token in yourGitHub account, and create a new property in the webadmin UI:\n\n\n\n\nkey: githubToken\n\n\nvalue: the github token created on the github account.\n\n\n\n\nKibana dashboard\n\n\nThe first time Kibana is started, it will ask for a default index pattern. To select one, log into the dashboard (admin/admin), go to the dashboard menu item and select \nmetrics-scava\n. Then click on the star on the top right. \n\n\nContinuous integration\n\n\nWe use Codefresh for the CI of our docker images.

(More about JWT : https://jwt.io)\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Architecture\n\n\nIn Scava, the authentification service is a sub component of the Administration Application which centralise Right Management for the whole platform.

In particular, Sec 2 presents an overview of the main development workflow by highlighting the main tools of the supporting development infrastructure. Section 3 mentions peculiar conventions that have to be adopted to write source code and to perform changes. Section 4 makes a list of tools supporting communication and collaboration among the different partners. Section 5 gives some important remarks related to the Scava project and its development.\n\n\nProcess overview\n\n\nThe development of the Scava components and of the integrated platform should follow the process shown in the following figure. Essentially, the development relies on the availability of a source code repository (to enable collaborative development) and of a Continuous Integration Server (to do the building and integration on behalf of the developers). Different deployment environments can be considered for deploying the built system.\n\n\nIt is important to remark that Continuous Integration (CI) requires that the different developers have self-testing code. This is code that tests itself to ensure that it is working as expected, and these tests are often called unit tests. When all the unit tests pass after the code is integrated, developers will get a green build. This indicates that they have verified that their changes are successfully integrated together, and the code is working as expected by the tests.\n\n\nThe different elements shown below are individually described in the remaining of the section.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Overview of the CROSSMINER development process and tools\n\n\nSource Code Repository\n\n\nDifferent branches will be created in the repository. In particular, the \nmaster\n branch is the main branch and represents the released state of the product. It is always clean, builds and runs all the tests successfully. The \ndev\n branch contains the most recent code integrated by partners before release.\n\n\nOther branches will be created for the different features/components, which will be eventually merged in the \ndev\n branch. The name of each branch contains the id of the issue it is supposed to implement.\n\n\nAll source code, binary code and con\ufb01guration needed to build a working implementation of the system will reside in a GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\nCode: https://github.com/crossminer/scava\n\n\nProduct documentation: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-docs\n\n\nProduct deployment: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-deployment\n\n\n\n\nSince all source code will be stored in a single GitHub repository, each developer will have a working copy of the entire project. To simplify collaboration, each component will be contained in one subdirectory within the source structure (see Sec. 3 for details).\n\n\nBy taking inspiration from https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html the branching model that will be followed will resemble that shown in Fig. 2 without making use of the release and hotfixes branches. Details about the change conventions, pull requests, etc. are given in Sec. 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Branching model\n\n\nTests\n\n\nEach branch must have the corresponding unit tests. The dev branch must have integration tests and the unit tests of all the features that have been already merged as shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Explanatory master and branches\n\n\nBRANCH: Set of branches\nTEST: Set of tests\nINTGRATION_TEST < TEST\nUNIT_TEST < TEST\n\nfunction test: BRANCH -> TEST\n\ntest(master) -> test(cool-feature)\n    \u22c3 {itu, \u2026 itz}\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Integration Server\n\n\nContinuous integration (CI) involves integrating early and often, so as to avoid the pitfalls of \"integration hell\". The practice aims to reduce rework and thus \nreduce cost and time\n.\n\n\nA complementary practice to CI is that before submitting work, each programmer must do a complete build and run (and pass) all \nunit tests\n. \nIntegration tests\n are usually run automatically on a CI server when it detects a new commit. In particular, a CI server provides developers with at least the following functionalities:\n\n\n\n\nAllow developers to write unit tests that can be executed automatically\n\n\nPerform automated tests against newly written code\n\n\nShow a list of tests that have passed and failed\n\n\nQuality analysis on source code\n\n\nPerform all the necessary actions to create a fully functioning build of the software when all tests have passed\n\n\n\n\nThe currently used CI server is available at http://ci5.castalia.camp:8080/\n\n\nDevelopment and Production environments\n\n\nAccording to the DoW we have not promised the availability of a public installation of the CROSSMINER platform (i.e., a production environment). However, in order to implement the different use cases, use case partners are provided with docker images enabling the local installation of the whole CROSSMINER platform.\n\n\nNaming and change conventions\n\n\nThe repository will contain the code of the high-level components shown in Table 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nCorresponding folder in repository\n\n\nLeader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevOps Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nBIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow Diagram Editor\n\n\n/crossflow\n\n\nYORK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration Web Application\n\n\n/administration\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDE\n\n\n/eclipse-based-ide\n\n\nFEA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Gateway\n\n\n/api-gateway\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevOps Backend\n\n\n\n\nBIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Base\n\n\n/knowledge-base\n\n\nUDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Analyser\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collector\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Scheduler\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric Providers\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nYORK, CWI, AUEB, EHU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Storage\n\n\n/metric-platform\n\n\nSFT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb-based dashboards\n\n\n/web-dashboards\n\n\nBIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Leaders and Contributors of the CROSSMINER Deployment diagram nodes\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scava components architecture\n\n\nFor each component a corresponding folder is available in the repository. Changes must have a CR (i.e. issue) entry for traceability. In particular, the requirements and objectives of each Scava components will be detailed in the relevant deliverables and they will be added in the form of items in the provided Bug Tracking infrastructure.

Essentially, the development relies on the availability of a source code repository (to enable collaborative development) and of a Continuous Integration Server (to do the building and integration on behalf of the developers). Different deployment environments can be considered for deploying the built system.  It is important to remark that Continuous Integration (CI) requires that the different developers have self-testing code. This is code that tests itself to ensure that it is working as expected, and these tests are often called unit tests. When all the unit tests pass after the code is integrated, developers will get a green build. This indicates that they have verified that their changes are successfully integrated together, and the code is working as expected by the tests.  The different elements shown below are individually described in the remaining of the section.  \nFigure 1. Overview of the CROSSMINER development process and tools",

In this file, we will define our data model.\n\n\nFirst of all, we need to state the name of the package.\n\n\npackage org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.model;\n\n\n\n\nThis is used by the Pongo code generator - the generated classes will be put in this package.\n\n\nWe then define the database for our model:\n\n\n@db(qualifiedCollectionNames=\"true\")\nclass Commits {\n    val Repository[*] repositories;\n    val Commit[*] commits;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \n@db\n annotation tells Pongo that this will be the container database for the data. Adding the \nqualifiedCollectionNames=true\n property will prepend the database name to all Mongo collections. \n\n\nThe \nCommits\n class above says that we want a database with two collections, name \nrepositories\n and \ncommits\n. If \nqualifiedCollectionNames\n is set to \ntrue\n, the collections will be named \nCommits.repositories\n and \nCommits.commits\n. \n\n\nWe now define the schema of the \nCommits.repositories\n collection:\n\n\n~~~java\nclass Repository {\n    @searchable\n    attr String url;\n    attr String repoType;\n    attr String revision;\n    attr int totalNumberOfCommits;\n    ref CommitData[*] commits;\n}\n\n\n\nThis class is used to store information related to the commits in the project's VCS repositories. The collection will contain one entry per VCS repository. Repositories are identified by a `url`, and also have a `repoType` (e.g. Git or SVN), the latest `revision`, the `totalNumberOfCommits`, and a reference to all of the `commits` in the repository, which are stored in the `Commits.commits` collection.\n\nThe `@searchable` annotation will make Pongo generate two utility search methods on the collection: `findByUrl(String url) : Iterable<Repository>` and `findOneByUrl(String url) : Repository`. An index will also be create on this field to improve look up time.\n\nEach commit is represented in the `Commits.commits` collection by the following model:\n\n~~~~java\nclass Commit {\n    @searchable\n    attr Date date;\n    attr String identifier;\n    attr String message;\n    attr String author;\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor each commit, we store its \ndate\n, \nidentifier\n (revision ID), the commit \nmessage\n, and the \nauthor\n. We also create an index on the \ndate\n to allow us to quickly discover the set of commits that occurred on a given date (using the autogenerated \nfindByDate(String date)\n or \nfindOneByDate(String date)\n methods).\n\n\nNow we need to use Pongo to generate code from this model. Right-click on the \ncommits.emf\n file and select \nPongo > Generate Pongos and plugin.xml\n. You should see some Java classes appear in your package.\n\n\nNow that we have our data model, we can implement the metric provider.\n\n\n2. The metric provider\n\n\nCreate a Java class called \norg.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.CommitsTransientMetricProvider\n\n\nThis class should extend \nAbstractTransientMetricProvider\n and specify \nCommits\n for the generic argument:\n\n\npublic class org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.CommitsTransientMetricProvider extends AbstractTransientMetricProvider<Commits>\n\n\n\n\nThe generic argument states that the metric provider stores objects conforming to the \nCommits\n data model. Note: You do not need to extend \nAbstractTransientMetricProvider\n and can implement \nITransientMetricProvider\n instead should you wish to.\n\n\nThere are a number of methods that need implementing. We will discuss each in turn.\n\n\nadapt(DB db)\n\n\nThis method returns the Pongo database that the metric provider will use to store its data. This is boilerplate, unfortunately, we can't auto-generate it. Implement as follows:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public Commits adapt(DB db) {\n        return new Commits(db);\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing we want to do is fill in useful information that helps users understand the purpose of the metric provider:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public String getShortIdentifier() { // This may be deprecated very soon\n        return \"transient-commits\"; \n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getFriendlyName() {\n        return \"Commit History\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getSummaryInformation() {\n        return \"The commit history of the project.\";\n    }\n\n\n\n\nThe next method allows you to declare whether the metric provider is applicable to a given project:\n\n\n@Override\n    public boolean appliesTo(Project project) {\n        return project.getVcsRepositories().size() > 0;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nOur metric applies to any project that has at least one VCS repository.\n\n\nFinally, we have the \nmeasure(...)\n method that performs the actual metric calculation:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void measure(Project project, ProjectDelta delta, Commits db) {\n\n        for (VcsRepositoryDelta repoDelta : delta.getVcsDelta().getRepoDeltas()) {\n            Repository repo = db.getRepositories().findOneByUrl(repoDelta.getRepository().getUrl());\n\n            if (repo == null) {\n                repo = new Repository();\n                repo.setUrl(repoDelta.getRepository().getUrl());\n                db.getRepositories().add(repo);\n            }\n\n            for (VcsCommit commit : repoDelta.getCommits()) {\n                Commit c = new Commit();\n                c.setDate(commit.getJavaDate());\n                c.setMessage(commit.getMessage());\n                c.setAuthor(commit.getAuthor());\n                c.setIdentifier(commit.getRevision());\n\n                repo.getCommits().add(c);\n                db.getCommits().add(c);\n            }\n        }\n        db.getCommits().sync();\n        db.getRepositories().sync();\n    }\n\n\n\n\nThe above method iterates through the delta computed by the platform. The delta consists of the commits that occurred in each of the project's VCS repositories for the date being analysed. A new \nCommit\n object is created for each commit in the delta.\n\n\n3. Make the metric provider discoverable\n\n\nMetric providers are registered with the OSSMETER platform using \nextension points\n:\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file and select the 'Extensions' tab\n\n\nClick the Add button and from the list select \norg.ossmeter.platform.metricprovider\n\n\nOn the right hand side of the editor, you will now see a text box with the label 'provider' and a 'Browse...' button.\n\n\nClick the 'Browse...' button and select the 'CommitsTransientMetricProvider' class\n\n\n\n\nNow everything is ready for the metric to be executed :)\n\n\nThe Historic Metric Provider\n\n\nThis metric provider will keep track of the total number of commits of the project over time. For each date of the project, the metric counts how many commits have been made and stores the value.  \n\n\n0. Setup\n\n\nCreate a new Plugin project in Eclipse.  \n\n\n\n\nGo to File > New > Project... and select 'Plug-in project'\n\n\nGive the project an appropriate name. The OSSMETER naming convention is:\n\n\nTransient metrics: org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.(metric name)\n\n\nHistorical metrics: org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historical.(metric name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Next\n\n\nIf the \"This plug-in will make contributions to the UI\" checkbox is ticked, uncheck it\n\n\nClick Finish\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file in your new project. Open the 'Dependencies' tab and add 'com.googlecode.pongo.runtime', 'org.ossmeter.platform', and 'org.ossmeter.repository.model' to the dependency list.\n\n\n\n\n1. The data model\n\n\nIn your newly created plug-in, create a package called org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.model. In that package create an empty file called historiccommits.emf. In this file, we will define our data model:\n\n\npackage org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.model;\n\nclass HistoricCommits {\n    attr int numberOfCommits;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe data model for the historic metric is much simpler. No Pongo annotations are used because, unlike transient metrics, the platform is responsible for storing the historic data. The data model defined here will be stored against the date that the analysis is performed.\n\n\n2. The metric provider\n\n\nCreate a Java class called org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historical.commits.CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider\n\n\nThis class should extend AbstractHistoricalMetricProvider (there are no generic arguments (yet!)):\n\n\npublic class org.ossmeter.metricprovider.trans.commits.CommitsTransientMetricProvider extends AbstractTransientMetricProvider\n\nThe generic argument states that the metric provider stores objects conforming to the Commits data model. Note: You do not need to extend AbstractTransientMetricProvider and can implement ITransientMetricProvider instead should you wish to.\n\n\nThere are a number of methods that need implementing. We will discuss each in turn.\n\n\nFirst of all, complete the typical information-related methods:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public String getShortIdentifier() {\n        return \"historicalcommits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getFriendlyName() {\n        return \"Historical commits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getSummaryInformation() {\n        return \"...\";\n    }\n\n\n\n\nNow complete the standard \nappliesTo\n method:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean appliesTo(Project project) {\n        return project.getVcsRepositories().size() > 0;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to specify a dependency on the transient metric provider that we just implemented.\n\n\n    @Override\n    public List<String> getIdentifiersOfUses() {\n        return Arrays.asList(CommitsTransientMetricProvider.class.getCanonicalName());\n    }   \n\n\n\n\nThis tells the platform that we need access to the \nCommitsTransientMetricProvider\n database. The platform will assign this to the \nuses\n field that is available to the historical metric provider, as you'll see in the \nmeasure\n method:\n\n\n    @Override\n    public Pongo measure(Project project) {\n        Commits transDb = (Commits) getDbOfMetricProvider(project, (ITransientMetricProvider) uses.get(0));\n\n        int commits = (int) transDb.getCommits().size();\n\n        HistoricCommits hist = new HistoricCommits();\n        hist.setNumberOfCommits(commits);\n\n        return hist;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we get hold of the database of the transient commits metric provider, and simply count the size of the \ncommits\n collection. We save this in an instance of the \nHistoricCommits\n Pongo defined above. This object is returned by the method and the platform stores it in the database along with the date that is currently being analysed for the project.\n\n\n3. Make the metric provider discoverable\n\n\nThis process is the same as the transient metric provider:\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file and select the 'Extensions' tab\n\n\nClick the Add button and from the list select \norg.ossmeter.platform.metricprovider\n\n\nOn the right hand side of the editor, you will now see a text box with the label 'provider' and a 'Browse...' button.\n\n\nClick the 'Browse...' button and select the 'CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider' class\n\n\n\n\nNow everything is ready for both metrics to be executed :)\n\n\nBut first. Let's specify how we want this historical metric to be visualised.\n\n\n4. Define a MetVis visualisation specification\n\n\nMetVis\n is a JSON-based specification language and visualisation engine for metrics. You specify how the Pongo data model should be transformed into something that can be plotted on a chart. The MetVis \nweb page\n has numerous examples of this.\n\n\nCreate a folder in your historical metric project called 'vis'. In the 'vis' folder create a file called 'historicalcommits.json'. Here is the MetVis specification for the historical commits metric provider:\n\n\n{\n    \"metricid\" : \"org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider\",\n    \"vis\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"historicalcommits\",\n            \"name\" : \"Commits over time\",\n            \"description\" : \"This metric shows when the projects commits occurred\",\n            \"type\" : \"LineChart\",\n            \"datatable\" : {\n                \"cols\" : [\n                    { \"name\" : \"Date\", \"field\" : \"$__date\" },\n                    { \"name\" : \"Commits\", \"field\" : \"$numberOfCommits\" }\n                ]\n            },\n            \"x\" : \"Date\",\n            \"y\" : \"Commits\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmetricId\n field tells the platform which metric provider the specification visualises. A metric provider can have multiple visualisations. In this case, we just define one, which plots the date on the X-axis and the number of commits on the Y-axis. Fields in the Pongo data model are references using the $-sign. To access the date field of a historical metric, use \n$__date\n. The final two fields (\nx\n and \ny\n) are references to column names in the datatable specification. The \ntype\n states that the data should be plotted as a line chart. You can test your MetVis specifications on the \nMetVis playpen\n.\n\n\n5. Make the visualisation specification discoverable\n\n\nAs with metric providers, visualisation specifications are registered using extension points.\n\n\n\n\nAdd the 'org.ossmeter.platform.visualisation' plugin as a dependency on your project\n\n\nOpen up the plugin.xml file and select the 'Extensions' tab\n\n\nClick the Add button and from the list select \norg.ossmeter.platform.visualisation.metric\n\n\nOn the right hand side of the editor, you will now see a text box with the label 'provider' and a 'Browse...' button.\n\n\nClick the 'Browse...' button and select the 'historicalcommits.json' file\n\n\n\n\nGood job.\n\n\nRunning the metric providers\n\n\nSee \nRunning from Source\n\n\nHomework\n\n\nAdapt the historical commits metric provider so that it stores the commits for each repository separately (in the above, it sums them all up). Write the MetVis specification - each series should be the commits for separate repositories.",

Note: You do not need to extend AbstractTransientMetricProvider and can implement ITransientMetricProvider instead should you wish to.  There are a number of methods that need implementing. We will discuss each in turn.  First of all, complete the typical information-related methods:      @Override\n    public String getShortIdentifier() {\n        return \"historicalcommits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getFriendlyName() {\n        return \"Historical commits\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getSummaryInformation() {\n        return \"...\";\n    }  Now complete the standard  appliesTo  method:      @Override\n    public boolean appliesTo(Project project) {\n        return project.getVcsRepositories().size() > 0;\n    }  We now need to specify a dependency on the transient metric provider that we just implemented.      @Override\n    public List<String> getIdentifiersOfUses() {\n        return Arrays.asList(CommitsTransientMetricProvider.class.getCanonicalName());\n    }     This tells the platform that we need access to the  CommitsTransientMetricProvider  database. The platform will assign this to the  uses  field that is available to the historical metric provider, as you'll see in the  measure  method:      @Override\n    public Pongo measure(Project project) {\n        Commits transDb = (Commits) getDbOfMetricProvider(project, (ITransientMetricProvider) uses.get(0));\n\n        int commits = (int) transDb.getCommits().size();\n\n        HistoricCommits hist = new HistoricCommits();\n        hist.setNumberOfCommits(commits);\n\n        return hist;\n    }  First of all, we get hold of the database of the transient commits metric provider, and simply count the size of the  commits  collection. We save this in an instance of the  HistoricCommits  Pongo defined above. This object is returned by the method and the platform stores it in the database along with the date that is currently being analysed for the project.",

You specify how the Pongo data model should be transformed into something that can be plotted on a chart. The MetVis  web page  has numerous examples of this.  Create a folder in your historical metric project called 'vis'. In the 'vis' folder create a file called 'historicalcommits.json'. Here is the MetVis specification for the historical commits metric provider:  {\n    \"metricid\" : \"org.ossmeter.metricprovider.historic.commits.CommitsHistoricalMetricProvider\",\n    \"vis\" : [\n        {\n            \"id\" : \"historicalcommits\",\n            \"name\" : \"Commits over time\",\n            \"description\" : \"This metric shows when the projects commits occurred\",\n            \"type\" : \"LineChart\",\n            \"datatable\" : {\n                \"cols\" : [\n                    { \"name\" : \"Date\", \"field\" : \"$__date\" },\n                    { \"name\" : \"Commits\", \"field\" : \"$numberOfCommits\" }\n                ]\n            },\n            \"x\" : \"Date\",\n            \"y\" : \"Commits\"\n        }\n    ]\n}  The  metricId  field tells the platform which metric provider the specification visualises. A metric provider can have multiple visualisations. In this case, we just define one, which plots the date on the X-axis and the number of commits on the Y-axis. Fields in the Pongo data model are references using the $-sign. To access the date field of a historical metric, use  $__date . The final two fields ( x  and  y ) are references to column names in the datatable specification. The  type  states that the data should be plotted as a line chart.

The RESTLET framework is integrated in the platform in a single OSGI plugin :\n\n\n\n\norg.eclipse.crossmeter.platform.client.api.  \n\n\n\n\nThe RESTLET framework used an embedded web server. In order to avoid to multiply the number of deployed web servers, we plan to centralize all REST service implementation in the same plug-in.\n\n\nYou want to access to create a new REST Service ?\n\n\n1. Create a new Route\n\n\nTo  register a new RESTLET service, the first step is to define the route (base url which allow to access to this service) and make the link between this route an the implementation of the service.\n\n\nNaming the Route\n\n\nThe routes (Base URL) of services provided by the platform is normalize. Please refer to this guideline to know ho to define the route of the new service : \nNaming-Scava-REST-Services.html\n\n\nRegister the Route\n\n\nThe \norg.scava.platform.services\n plug-in contained the class \nPlatformRoute.java\n  responsible for declaring routes.\n\n\npackage org.scava.platform.services;\nimport org.restlet.Application;\nimport org.restlet.Restlet;\nimport org.restlet.routing.Router;\n\npublic class PlatformRoute extends Application {\n    @Override\n    public Restlet createInboundRoot() {\n        Router router = new Router(getContext());\n\n        router.attach(\"/\", PingResource.class);     \n        router.attach(\"/search\", SearchProjectResource.class);\n                ...\n                router.attach(\"/projects/p/{projectid}\", ProjectResource.class);\n        router.attach(\"/raw/metrics\", RawMetricListResource.class);\n        ...\n        return router;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nRoute Example :\n\n\nrouter.attach(\"/raw/metrics\", RawMetricListResource.class);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"/raw/metrics\"\n: Represent the route URL.\n\n\n\"RawMetricListResource.class\"\n : Represent the class where the service to be implemented for this path.\n\n\n\n\nA route can contained some parameters. In this case, parameters are identified by a name with curly brackets \n{}\n.\n\n\n2. Implement the Service\n\n\nA service implementation is a Java class which extend the \nServerResource\n class provided by the RESTLET framework.\nTo create a new service create a new Class :\n\n Named \"\nServiceName\n\" + Resource.  Ex : ProjectCreationResource.java\n\n On a namespace based on the  route. Ex : org.scava.platform.services.administration for platform administration services.\n* Who extend the org.restlet.resource.ServerResource class.\n\n\nGET Service\n\n\nTo implement a service of type GET, create a new method :\n\n Based on the following signature : public final Representation represent()\n\n Add the @Get(\"json\") annotation\n\n\n\n@Get(\"json\")\npublic final Representation represent() {\n  // Initialise Response Header\n  Series<Header> responseHeaders = (Series<Header>) getResponse().getAttributes().get(\"org.restlet.http.headers\");\n   if (responseHeaders == null) {\n    responseHeaders = new Series(Header.class);\n     getResponse().getAttributes().put(\"org.restlet.http.headers\", responseHeaders);\n  }\n  responseHeaders.add(new Header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\"));\n  responseHeaders.add(new Header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"GET\"));\n\n  // Get Route parameter if required {projectid}\n  String projectId = (String) getRequest().getAttributes().get(\"projectid\");\n\n\n  try {\n    ....\n    // Provide Result\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.SUCCESS_OK);\n    return new StringRepresentation(...);\n  } catch (IOException e) {\n    StringRepresentation rep = new StringRepresentation(\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\", \\\"message\\\" : \\\"\"+e.getMessage()+\"\\\"}\");\n    rep.setMediaType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.CLIENT_ERROR_BAD_REQUEST);\n    return rep;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also extend the \nAbstractApiResource\n , a service class  provided by the platform and dedicate to services who request a connection to MongoDb database instead of the \nServerResource\n. In this case you will have to implement the doRepresent() method.\n\n\npublic class RawMetricListResource extends AbstractApiResource {\n    public Representation doRepresent() {\n        ObjectNode res = mapper.createObjectNode();\n\n        ArrayNode metrics = mapper.createArrayNode();\n        res.put(\"metrics\", metrics);\n        ...\n        return Util.createJsonRepresentation(res);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nPOST Service\n\n\nTo implement a service of type POST, crate a new method :\n\n Based on the following signature : public Representation \nmyServiceName\n (Representation entity)\n\n Add the @Post annotation\n\n\n@Post\npublic Representation myServiceName(Representation entity) {\n  try {\n    // Read Json Datas\n    JsonNode json = mapper.readTree(entity.getText());\n\n    ...\n\n    // Provide Result\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.SUCCESS_CREATED);\n    return new StringRepresentation(...);\n\n  } catch (IOException e) {\n    StringRepresentation rep = new StringRepresentation(\"{\\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\", \\\"message\\\" : \\\"\"+e.getMessage()+\"\\\"}\");\n    rep.setMediaType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n    getResponse().setStatus(Status.CLIENT_ERROR_BAD_REQUEST);\n   return rep;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDELETE Service\n\n\nTo do ....\n\n\n3. Document the Service\n\n\nThe REST services are the main integration points between platform components or between the platform and external clients. This services are the implementation of a contract between the service provider and his consumers. In order to  allow an easy integration, this contract must be documented :\n\n\n4.

For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner.

The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved.

I've created an OpenAPI specification and then built it with the generator. You will see a minimalistic configuration: it contains a single path specification, which requires one number input parameter and then gives back the parameters square. The number input parameter is provided via the path, so it looks like the following: \n/square/{number}\n. You can replace the \n{number}\n with any number. The repsonse for this request is a \nJSON\n object, which looks like this:\n\n\n{\n    \"squared\": {squaredValue}\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt contains only one field, named \nsquared\n, which has the value of the square of the given number. From the specification the generator will provide us a \nJava Project\n which will implement the use of the specified API. It will provide us an interface to easily access the functionalities of the API. To use this interface, after the import of the proper dependencies, we only need to write a few lines:\n\n\nITestAPIApi api = TestAPIApi.createDefault(); //create an instance of the api interface (with default settings).\nint number = 7; //The number to be squared.\nIData<NumberValue> squared = api.getSquareNumberValueByNumber(number); //the actual use of the API descibed in the specification. It sends a request to the server.\nNumberValue numberValue; //NumberValue is the class which represents the object received from the server\nnumberValue = squared.observe().blockingSingle(); //Get the actually received object from the response.\nSystem.out.println(\"Squared:\" + numberValue.getSquared()); //Print the received answer.\n\n\n\n\nEverything, including the \nIEntityApi\n interface and the \nNumberValue\n class is generated by the generator. The former is a complete set of the functions provided by the API and the latter is an example of the container classes, which has the purpose of letting access through \nJava\n to the objects/field inside of the received \nJSON\n object. And once again, they are all generated from the OpenAPI specification.\n\n\nSo, to generate the mentioned \nJava Project\n, you have to put your OpenAPI specification file into the \nschemas\n folder inside the \norg.eclipse.crossmeter.workflow.restmule.generator\n project. I'll call mine as \nTestAPI.json\n, and it's made up of the following:\n\n\n{\n  \"swagger\": \"2.0\",\n  \"schemes\": [\n    \"http\"\n  ],\n  \"host\": \"localhost:8080\",\n  \"basePath\": \"/\",\n  \"info\": {\n    \"description\": \"This is a test API, only for demonstration of the generator.\",\n    \"termsOfService\": \"\",\n    \"title\": \"TestAPI\",\n    \"version\": \"v1\"\n  },\n  \"consumes\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"produces\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"securityDefinitions\": {\n\n  },\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/square/{number}\": {\n      \"get\": {\n        \"description\": \"Square a number.\",\n        \"parameters\": [\n          {\n            \"description\": \"The number to be squared\",\n            \"in\": \"path\",\n            \"name\": \"number\",\n            \"required\": true,\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"OK\",\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/NumberValue\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"definitions\": {\n    \"NumberValue\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"squared\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"type\": \"object\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can see here the path and the NumberValue object. They are well specified in this file, so the generator can create our project by on its own.\nThen we have to set the generator to use our new schema. To do this, open the \nbuild.xml\n in the generator project and modify the \napi\n and \njson.model.file\n property to \ntestapi\n and \nschemas/TestAPI.json\n, respectively.\n\n\n<!--API Variables -->\n<property name=\"api\" value=\"testapi\" />\n<property name=\"json.model.file\" value=\"schemas/TestAPI.json\" />\n\n\n\n\nWe are almost done, but we have to take one more small step. We have to provide an \n.eol\n file in the \nepsilon/util/fix/\n folder in the generator project. Its name must be the same as the value of the \napi\n property in the previous step, so for this example we use the \ntestapi.eol\n. The content of this file:\n\n\nimport \"../restmule.eol\";\n\nvar api = RestMule!API.all.first();\n\n// RATE LIMITS\n\nvar search = new RestMule!RatePolicyScope;\nsearch.scope = \"Search\";\nvar entity = new RestMule!RatePolicyScope;\nentity.scope = \"Entity\";\n\n// RATE POLICY\n\nvar policy = new RestMule!RatePolicy;\npolicy.scopes.add(entity);\npolicy.scopes.add(search);\n\nvar reset = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nvar resetInt = new RestMule!TInteger;\nresetInt.label = \"X-RateLimit-Reset\";\nreset.type = resetInt;\npolicy.reset = reset;\n\nvar limit = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nvar limitInt = new RestMule!TInteger;\nlimitInt.label = \"X-RateLimit-Limit\";\nlimit.type = limitInt;\npolicy.limit = limit;\n\nvar remaining = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nvar remainingInt = new RestMule!TInteger;\nremainingInt.label = \"X-RateLimit-Remaining\";\nremaining.type = remainingInt;\npolicy.remaining = remaining;\n\napi.ratePolicy = policy;\n\n// PAGINATION\n\nvar pagination= new RestMule!PaginationPolicy;\npagination.start = 1;\npagination.max = 10;\npagination.increment = 1;\npagination.maxPerIteration = 100;\n\nvar perIteration = new RestMule!Query;\nperIteration.description = \"Items per page\";\nperIteration.required = false;\nvar type = new RestMule!TInteger;\ntype.label = \"per_page\";\ntype.name = type.label;\nperIteration.type = type;\npagination.perIteration = perIteration;\n\nvar page = new RestMule!Query;\npage.description = \"Page identifier\";\npage.required = false;\nvar type1 = new RestMule!TInteger;\ntype1.label = \"page\";\ntype1.name = type1.label;\npage.type = type1;\npagination.page = page;\n\nvar link = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nlink.description = \"Page links\";\nvar format = new RestMule!TFormattedString;\nformat.label = \"Link\";\nformat.name = format.label;\nlink.type = format;\npagination.links = link;\n\napi.pagination = pagination;\n\n// WRAPPER\n\nvar wrapper = new RestMule!Wrapper;\nwrapper.name = \"Wrapper\";\nvar items = new RestMule!ListType;\nitems.label = \"items\";\nwrapper.items = items;\nwrapper.totalLabel= \"total_count\";\nwrapper.incompleteLabel = \"incomplete_results\";\napi.pageWrapper = wrapper;\n\n// ADD RATE & WRAPPER TO REQUESTS (FIXME)\n\nfor (r in RestMule!Request.all){\n    if (r.parent.path.startsWith(\"/search\")){\n        r.scope = search;\n    } else {\n        r.scope = entity;\n    }\n    r.parameters.removeAll(r.parameters.select(p|p.instanceOf(RequestHeader)));\n    for (resp in r.responses.select(s|s.responseType <> null)){\n        resp.unwrap();\n    }\n}\n\n/*  //////////\n * OPERATIONS\n *//////////\noperation RestMule!ObjectType hasWrapper() : Boolean {\n    var wrapper = RestMule!Wrapper.all.first;\n    var lists = self.listFields.collect(a|a.label);\n    return (not lists.isEmpty()) and lists\n        .includes(wrapper.items.label);\n}\n\noperation RestMule!Response unwrap() : RestMule!ObjectType{\n    if (self.responseType.instanceOf(ObjectType)){\n        if (self.responseType.hasWrapper()){\n            (\"Unwrapping : \"+ self.responseType.name).println;\n            var wrapper = RestMule!Wrapper.all.first;\n            var name = self.responseType.name.println;\n            self.responseType = self.responseType.println.listFields\n                .select(b| b.label == wrapper.items.label).first.elements.first;            \n            self.responseType.name = name;\n            self.pageWrapped = true;\n            self.responseType.description = \"UNWRAPPED: \" + self.responseType.description;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAfter this, we can run the generator and it will generate our \nJava Project\n from the specification.\n\n\nIn the attached zip you can find all of the releated projects and files. There is a spring-boot server, which can serve the request, a java client, which uses the generated project, an eclipse plug-in project which also uses the generated project, the generated project and the additional files for the generator. And there is one more project, which provides the proper dependecies for the plug-in project.",

You will see a minimalistic configuration: it contains a single path specification, which requires one number input parameter and then gives back the parameters square. The number input parameter is provided via the path, so it looks like the following:  /square/{number} . You can replace the  {number}  with any number. The repsonse for this request is a  JSON  object, which looks like this:  {\n    \"squared\": {squaredValue}\n}  It contains only one field, named  squared , which has the value of the square of the given number. From the specification the generator will provide us a  Java Project  which will implement the use of the specified API. It will provide us an interface to easily access the functionalities of the API. To use this interface, after the import of the proper dependencies, we only need to write a few lines:  ITestAPIApi api = TestAPIApi.createDefault(); //create an instance of the api interface (with default settings).\nint number = 7; //The number to be squared.\nIData<NumberValue> squared = api.getSquareNumberValueByNumber(number); //the actual use of the API descibed in the specification. It sends a request to the server.\nNumberValue numberValue; //NumberValue is the class which represents the object received from the server\nnumberValue = squared.observe().blockingSingle(); //Get the actually received object from the response.\nSystem.out.println(\"Squared:\" + numberValue.getSquared()); //Print the received answer.  Everything, including the  IEntityApi  interface and the  NumberValue  class is generated by the generator. The former is a complete set of the functions provided by the API and the latter is an example of the container classes, which has the purpose of letting access through  Java  to the objects/field inside of the received  JSON  object. And once again, they are all generated from the OpenAPI specification.  So, to generate the mentioned  Java Project , you have to put your OpenAPI specification file into the  schemas  folder inside the  org.eclipse.crossmeter.workflow.restmule.generator  project. I'll call mine as  TestAPI.json , and it's made up of the following:  {\n  \"swagger\": \"2.0\",\n  \"schemes\": [\n    \"http\"\n  ],\n  \"host\": \"localhost:8080\",\n  \"basePath\": \"/\",\n  \"info\": {\n    \"description\": \"This is a test API, only for demonstration of the generator.\",\n    \"termsOfService\": \"\",\n    \"title\": \"TestAPI\",\n    \"version\": \"v1\"\n  },\n  \"consumes\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"produces\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ],\n  \"securityDefinitions\": {\n\n  },\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/square/{number}\": {\n      \"get\": {\n        \"description\": \"Square a number.\",\n        \"parameters\": [\n          {\n            \"description\": \"The number to be squared\",\n            \"in\": \"path\",\n            \"name\": \"number\",\n            \"required\": true,\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"OK\",\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/NumberValue\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"definitions\": {\n    \"NumberValue\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"squared\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"type\": \"object\"\n    }\n  }\n}  You can see here the path and the NumberValue object. They are well specified in this file, so the generator can create our project by on its own.\nThen we have to set the generator to use our new schema. To do this, open the  build.xml  in the generator project and modify the  api  and  json.model.file  property to  testapi  and  schemas/TestAPI.json , respectively.  <!--API Variables -->\n<property name=\"api\" value=\"testapi\" />\n<property name=\"json.model.file\" value=\"schemas/TestAPI.json\" />  We are almost done, but we have to take one more small step. We have to provide an  .eol  file in the  epsilon/util/fix/  folder in the generator project. Its name must be the same as the value of the  api  property in the previous step, so for this example we use the  testapi.eol . The content of this file:  import \"../restmule.eol\";\n\nvar api = RestMule!API.all.first();\n\n// RATE LIMITS\n\nvar search = new RestMule!RatePolicyScope;\nsearch.scope = \"Search\";\nvar entity = new RestMule!RatePolicyScope;\nentity.scope = \"Entity\";\n\n// RATE POLICY\n\nvar policy = new RestMule!RatePolicy;\npolicy.scopes.add(entity);\npolicy.scopes.add(search);\n\nvar reset = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nvar resetInt = new RestMule!TInteger;\nresetInt.label = \"X-RateLimit-Reset\";\nreset.type = resetInt;\npolicy.reset = reset;\n\nvar limit = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nvar limitInt = new RestMule!TInteger;\nlimitInt.label = \"X-RateLimit-Limit\";\nlimit.type = limitInt;\npolicy.limit = limit;\n\nvar remaining = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nvar remainingInt = new RestMule!TInteger;\nremainingInt.label = \"X-RateLimit-Remaining\";\nremaining.type = remainingInt;\npolicy.remaining = remaining;\n\napi.ratePolicy = policy;\n\n// PAGINATION\n\nvar pagination= new RestMule!PaginationPolicy;\npagination.start = 1;\npagination.max = 10;\npagination.increment = 1;\npagination.maxPerIteration = 100;\n\nvar perIteration = new RestMule!Query;\nperIteration.description = \"Items per page\";\nperIteration.required = false;\nvar type = new RestMule!TInteger;\ntype.label = \"per_page\";\ntype.name = type.label;\nperIteration.type = type;\npagination.perIteration = perIteration;\n\nvar page = new RestMule!Query;\npage.description = \"Page identifier\";\npage.required = false;\nvar type1 = new RestMule!TInteger;\ntype1.label = \"page\";\ntype1.name = type1.label;\npage.type = type1;\npagination.page = page;\n\nvar link = new RestMule!ResponseHeader;\nlink.description = \"Page links\";\nvar format = new RestMule!TFormattedString;\nformat.label = \"Link\";\nformat.name = format.label;\nlink.type = format;\npagination.links = link;\n\napi.pagination = pagination;\n\n// WRAPPER\n\nvar wrapper = new RestMule!Wrapper;\nwrapper.name = \"Wrapper\";\nvar items = new RestMule!ListType;\nitems.label = \"items\";\nwrapper.items = items;\nwrapper.totalLabel= \"total_count\";\nwrapper.incompleteLabel = \"incomplete_results\";\napi.pageWrapper = wrapper;\n\n// ADD RATE & WRAPPER TO REQUESTS (FIXME)\n\nfor (r in RestMule!Request.all){\n    if (r.parent.path.startsWith(\"/search\")){\n        r.scope = search;\n    } else {\n        r.scope = entity;\n    }\n    r.parameters.removeAll(r.parameters.select(p|p.instanceOf(RequestHeader)));\n    for (resp in r.responses.select(s|s.responseType <> null)){\n        resp.unwrap();\n    }\n}\n\n/*  //////////\n * OPERATIONS\n *//////////\noperation RestMule!ObjectType hasWrapper() : Boolean {\n    var wrapper = RestMule!Wrapper.all.first;\n    var lists = self.listFields.collect(a|a.label);\n    return (not lists.isEmpty()) and lists\n        .includes(wrapper.items.label);\n}\n\noperation RestMule!Response unwrap() : RestMule!ObjectType{\n    if (self.responseType.instanceOf(ObjectType)){\n        if (self.responseType.hasWrapper()){\n            (\"Unwrapping : \"+ self.responseType.name).println;\n            var wrapper = RestMule!Wrapper.all.first;\n            var name = self.responseType.name.println;\n            self.responseType = self.responseType.println.listFields\n                .select(b| b.label == wrapper.items.label).first.elements.first;            \n            self.responseType.name = name;\n            self.pageWrapped = true;\n            self.responseType.description = \"UNWRAPPED: \" + self.responseType.description;\n        }\n    }\n}  After this, we can run the generator and it will generate our  Java Project  from the specification.  In the attached zip you can find all of the releated projects and files. There is a spring-boot server, which can serve the request, a java client, which uses the generated project, an eclipse plug-in project which also uses the generated project, the generated project and the additional files for the generator. And there is one more project, which provides the proper dependecies for the plug-in project.",

Issue tracking  metrics:   Number of bugs: It indicates how many bugs, through the time, are in total all the issue tracking systems related to a project.  Number of comments: This metric indicates, through the time, the evolution in the quantity of comments for all the bugs related to a project.  Emotions: This metric expresses, grosso modo, the emotions found in the issue tracker for a given project.  Number new bugs: It indicates how many bugs are created every delta through a lapse of time.  Number of new users: How many users are new in the bug tracking system.  Open time: This metric shows the average open time of an issue.  Number of patches: It indicates the number of patches located in the issue tracking system.  Number of request and replies: From all the comments in the issue tracking system, how many of them are replies and how many are requests.  Response time: It presents the average time to reply a comment in an issue tracker.  Sentiments: Which sentiments are found in a issue tracking system for a project.  Severity: The severity level of the bugs found in the issue tracker. This metric classifies a bug report into 1 of 7 severity levels such as Blocker, Critical, Major, Normal, Minor, Trivial or Enhancement.  Status: It indicates the issues status, like open or closed.  Topics: Using clustering methods, this metric indicates the topics that are discussed through the time.  Unasnwered bugs: It indicates how many issues do not have any reply.  Users: How many users are found in a issue tracker system.   Newsgroup  metrics   Number of articles; It determines the number of articles found in a newsgroup.  Emotions: Which emotions are found in the newgroup.  Number of threads: How many threads a newsgroup contains. In other words, how many different branches have been created since the first email was sent to the newsgroup.  Number of new users: How many users make use of the newsgroup.  Number of request and replies: From the total number of emails belonging to the newsgroup, how many of them are request and how many are replies.  Response time: The average time to reply a message.  Sentiments: The sentiments found in the newsgroup.  Severity: The severity level of the messages exchanges in the newsgroup. The severity is measured in terms of how severe an issue is.  Number of new threads: How many threads are created per delta.  Topics: Using the clustering algorithm, we determine which are the most frequent topics discussed in the newsgroup.  Number of unanswered topics: How many messages haven\u2019t been answered.  Number of users: Number of users that make use of the newsgroup.   Forums  metrics   Number of posts: For every topic (i.e. forum thread), how many posts in total exist.  Emotions: Which are the emotions located in the forum.  Number of topics: How many forum threads contain the forum.  Number of request and replies: From all the posts in the forum, how many are request and how many are reply.  Sentiments: Which are the sentiments that can be found in a forum.  Severity: In the case the forums are used to express issues, we can determine their severity.  Number of new topics: Number of new forum threads created.  Topics: Number of content topics, i.e. subjects, are discussed in the forum.   Number of unanswered topics: Number of forums threads which do not have a reply.",

It displays the global value and the evolution in time of the metrics. It includes also filters to ease the analysis of a specific group of metrics. The dashboard is composed of different tables and visualizations, the tables show some statistics on the metrics (e.g., number of metrics per type, name and project), while the visualizations plot the average, sum and max values for every snapshots of a given metric.\n\n\nThe Project Dashboard (dev/debug) allows to understand the SCAVA metrics in terms of global and time values. A screenshot of the dashboard is shown below, as can be seen, the tables on the left contain global values, while the visualizations on the right allow to understand the metrics evolution. Finally, the last row of the dashboard shows different numeric values as a result of applying different metrics to the metric values. \n\n\n\n\nOverview dashboard\n\n\nThe Overview dashboard, starting from top to bottom and from left to right, includes the following visualizations:\n\n\nFirst of all, there is a table that shows the list of last facts. Then there are two \"selection\" pies, a pie chart that shows the projects. It can be used to filter by project and a pie chart that shows the top projects. It can be used to filter by top project. To follow, there is a table with the last recommendations (they come from the trans.rascal.OO metrics) and a heat map that allows to compare the projects wrt to attributes of the quality model defined \nin prosoul\n. Then, there is a table that shows the similar projects in terms of recommendation, it describes if it's active, the type and the number of recommendations. The next row shows a bar chart that shows the evolution of bugs (fixed vs closed/non resolved) and another bar chart that shows the evolution of commits. The next two rows show two bar charts as well, starting with a bar chart that shows the evolution of percentage emotions (anger, joy, sadness, surprise, love) in bugs and a bar chart that shows the evolution of active and inactive users on bug tracker. Finally, the last row includes information about a pie chart and a bar chart that show the top 10 topics on comments and their evolution. \n\n\nThe figures below show an example of the dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactoids dashboard\n\n\nThe Factoids dashboard, starting from top to bottom and from left to right, includes the following visualizations in order to understand the factoids that are in the projects:\n\n\nThe first table shows the number of projects that have from one to four factoids and the next two \"selection\" pies in order to filter the dashboard by project or top project if it is required. The following radar shows an overview of the project and how the number of factoids are distributed on them, the table shows the last factoids added.\nThe following three heat maps show different specific factoids with the projects, grouped them by bugs, commits and code quality. The last large heat map shows all the projects and all the factoids with the corresponding values.\n\n\nThe figures below show an example of the dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependency dashboard\n\n\nThis Dependency dashboard is useful to show the dependecies. It contains the following visualizations/tables (from left to right, top to bottom):\n\n\nIt starts with a visualization that shows the number of total deps and two pie charts, the first one is a pie chart that shows the deps grouped by project and the second one is a pie chart that shows the deps grouped by top project. Then, there are two tables, one that shows the deps grouped by type (e.g., osgi and maven) and project and other table that shows the deps grouped by type and top project. Below the tables, there is a graph that relates projects to dependency names and a bar chart that shows the evolution of project deps. To finish the dashboard has a table that provides details (name, versions, project and datetime) of the project deps and a table that shows the old and new version of each dependency.\n\n\nThe figures below show an example of the dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevOps dependencies Dashboard\n\n\nThe Devops Dependencies dashboard, starting from top to bottom and from left to right, includes the following visualizations in order to understand the devops dependencies that are included in the project:\n\n\nFirst of all, it has a pie chart that shows the deps grouped by project, it has also a pie chart that shows the deps grouped by top project, these two pies can be used to filter the dashboard. then there are two tables, the first one shows the deps grouped by type (e.g., puppet and docker) and project, and the second one shows the deps grouped by type and top project. Below the tables, there is a graph that relates projects to dependency names and a bar chart that shows the evolution of project deps. Then, there are two tables, the first one provides details (name and versions) of the project deps and the second one shows the old and new version of each dependency. To finish, there is a graph that shows the relation between projects that are using configuration files, the relation can be derived from Puppet or Docker, the table shows the type of relation in addition.\n\n\nThe figures below show an example of the dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevOps smells dashboard\n\n\nThe DevOps smells dashboard includes two visualizations to focus on a specific project and/or top project. Two bar charts show the evolution of the smells extracted from puppet and docker. They rely on the following historic metrics:\n- puppet.designsmells.smells\n- puppet.implementation.smells\n- docker.smells\n\n\nTwo tables allow to focus on the smells details. The former shows information about design and configuration smells, while the latter gives insights about antipatterns smells. Both of them have the information of the file and the line.\n\n\nThe figures below show an example of the dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality model dashboard\n\n\nThe Quality model dashboard shows the quality model assessment based on the model available \nin prosoul repo\n\n\nIt starts with a table that ranks the projects based on the sum of their scores, which are the normalized values (0-5) of the metrics based on the threshold defined in the quality model and a pie chart that shows the projects.

Furthermore, as we have multiple queries that are linked through OR, we need to declare a query of type \nbool\n and \nshould\n. If the query would be to find the documentation entries that have a \nGetting Started\n, a \nDevelopment\n guide and have a neutral sentiment, instead of using a \nshould\n operation, it need to be used a \nmust\n.\n\n\nGET documentation.documentation.entry.nlp/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": [\n          {\n            \"match\" : {\n              \"documentation_types\": \"Started\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"match\" : {\n              \"documentation_types\": \"Development\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"term\":{\n              \"sentiment\" : \"__label__neutral\"\n            }\n          }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nSearching for GitHub Issues comments containing the word \nissue\n in the field \nplain_text\n:\n\n\nGET github.bug.comment.nlp/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"plain_text\": \"issue\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nSearching in all the indexes the string \nAst\u00e9rix\n:\n\n\nGET _search\n{\n \"query\": {\n   \"query_string\": {\n     \"query\": \"Ast\u00e9rix\"\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, as we are not quering any particular field, we use the \nquery_string\n.\n\n\nIf we would like to search either for \nAst\u00e9rix\n or \nOb\u00e9lix\n, we can use boolean operators:\n\n\nGET _search\n{\n \"query\": {\n   \"query_string\": {\n     \"query\": \"Ast\u00e9rix OR Ob\u00e9lix\"\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf both names must appear, instead of using OR, we can use AND.\n\n\nGET _search\n{\n \"query\": {\n   \"query_string\": {\n     \"query\": \"Ast\u00e9rix AND Ob\u00e9lix\"\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\nQuery strings such as \nAst\u00e9rix Ob\u00e9lix\n will be considered to have an implicit OR, i.e. \nAst\u00e9ric OR Ob\u00e9lix\n.\n\n\nGET _search\n{\n \"query\": {\n   \"query_string\": {\n     \"query\": \"Ast\u00e9rix Ob\u00e9lix\"\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf the we are looking for the exact combination of words, such as \nAst\u00e9rix and Ob\u00e9lix\n, we can use parenthesis to indicate ElasticSearch that the words should be split.\n\n\nGET _search\n{\n \"query\": {\n   \"query_string\": {\n     \"query\": \"(Ast\u00e9rix and Ob\u00e9lix) OR (Felix the Cat)\"\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nElasticSearch can do some statistics regarding the output of queries. In this example, we want extended statistics about the field readability in the documentation entries:\n\n\nGET documentation.documentation.entry.nlp/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\" : {\n        \"readability_stats\" : {\n            \"extended_stats\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"readability\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe option \nsize=0\n, indicates that only the aggregation with the statistics must be returned, otherwise the query will return the elements that also match the searching query.\n\n\nIf instead of wanting some statistics, we want to autogenerate histograms, then we can use the following query:\n\n\nPOST documentation.documentation.entry.nlp/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"histogram_analysis\": {\n      \"histogram\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"readability\",\n                \"interval\" : 2\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nWith the indexes it is possible to do aggregations and how many times a field value defined as a keyword, such as documentation_id, appears in an index.\n\n\nPOST documentation.documentation.entry.nlp/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0, \n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"doc_id\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"documentation_id\",\n        \"size\": 100\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}",

This snippet is quite useful, it shows a good example of how parsing the JSONArray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this, we can conclude the parsing of the JSON result by iterating across the JSONArray:\n\n\n// loop array \nJSONArray array = (JSONArray) jsonObject.get(\"weather\");\nIterator\n iterator = array.iterator(); \nJSONObject weather;\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) { \n        weather = (JSONObject)iterator.next();\n        String description = (String)weather.get(\"description\");\n        System.out.println(cityName+\": \"+description);\n    }\nFinally, at this point, our code looks like that:\n\n\npackage openweather.json_simple;\n\n\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\n\nimport org.json.simple.JSONArray;\nimport org.json.simple.JSONObject;\nimport org.json.simple.parser.JSONParser;\nimport org.json.simple.parser.ParseException;\n\n\n/*\n\n * Parse Open Weather API\n \n/\npublic class App {\n\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ParseException {\n    BufferedReader reader = null;\n    // Parsing of the API result\n    JSONParser parser = new JSONParser();\n    JSONObject jsonObject = (JSONObject) parser.parse(reader);\n    // Access the JSON object\n    String cityName = (String) jsonObject.get(\"name\");\n    // loop array \n    JSONArray array = (JSONArray) jsonObject.get(\"weather\");\n    Iterator<JSONObject> iterator = array.iterator(); \n    JSONObject weather;\n    while (iterator.hasNext()) { \n        weather = (JSONObject)iterator.next();\n        String description = (String)weather.get(\"description\");\n        System.out.println(cityName+\": \"+description);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess REST API result\n\n\nIt\u2019s time to implement the getCityWeatherReader method accessing to the the Open Weather REST API.\n- Let\u2019s start with the creation of the REST API URL. Before calling any recommender, the code looks like that:\n\n\npublic class App {\n    static String OpenWeathermapAPI = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid= {appid}\";\n    static String AppId = \"abbcea2020f75409af198b98de40e3a6\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ParseException {\n        // Creation of the REST API\n        String city = (args.length != 0)? args[0]:\"Toulouse\";\n        String restAPI = OpenWeathermapAPI.replace(\"{city}\", city);\n        restAPI = restAPI.replace(\"{appid}\", AppId);\n        URL url = new URL(restAPI);\n        // Call the  REST API\n        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the code for the top of the file to the openConnection call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the StackOverFlow recommender doesn\u2019t provide pertinent post. On the other hand, the Code Recommender provides an interesting code snippet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this, we can complete our code. Finally the code looks like that:\n\n\npackage openweather.json_simple;\n\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.net.HttpURLConnection;\nimport java.net.URL;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\nimport org.json.simple.JSONArray;\nimport org.json.simple.JSONObject;\nimport org.json.simple.parser.JSONParser;\nimport org.json.simple.parser.ParseException;\n\n\n/**\n * Parse Open Weather API\n */\npublic class App {\n    static String OpenWeathermapAPI = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={appid}\";\n    static String AppId = \"abbcea2020f75409af198b98de40e3a6\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ParseException {\n        // Creation of the REST API\n        String city = (args.length != 0)? args[0]:\"Toulouse\";\n        String restAPI = OpenWeathermapAPI.replace(\"{city}\", city);\n        restAPI = restAPI.replace(\"{appid}\", AppId);\n        URL url = new URL(restAPI);\n        // Call the  REST API\n        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n        int status = connection.getResponseCode(); \n        if (status == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) { \n        BufferedReader reader = null;\n        try {\n                reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));\n                // Parsing of the API result\n                JSONParser parser = new JSONParser();\n                JSONObject jsonObject = (JSONObject) parser.parse(reader);\n                // Access the JSON object\n                String cityName = (String) jsonObject.get(\"name\");\n                // loop array \n                JSONArray array = (JSONArray) jsonObject.get(\"weather\");\n                Iterator<JSONObject> iterator = array.iterator(); \n                JSONObject weather;\n                while (iterator.hasNext()) { \n                    weather = (JSONObject)iterator.next();\n                    String description = (String)weather.get(\"description\");\n                    System.out.println(cityName+\": \"+description);\n                }\n        } finally {\n            if (reader != null) reader.close();\n        }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIf we call the application without argument, we obtain:\n\n\nToulouse: light rain\n\n\n\nIf we call it with, let's say, Rome:\n\n\nRome: light rain\n\n\n\nand with London\n\n\nLondon: mist\n\n\n\nand Rio?\n\n\nRio: clear sky\n\n\n\nAt least we know where we should spend end of fall! ;-)\n\n\nTask 2: Migrate from an abandoned library to a better-supported one.\n\n\nOnce the task is done, the teacher asks the student to migrate from JSON-simple to Jackson-core library because the former is better supported and a better performance is guaranteed. \n\n\nSimilarities\n\n\nSimilar projects can be recommended from the Project search wizard. \n- Search for the json-simple library with the CROSSMINER Search project\n- Select the json-simple library in the list provided by the search dialog\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dialog offers the possibility to find similar projects using different methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Similarity\n: It is a weighted combination of Readme Similarity and Dependency Similarity\n\n\nCrossSim Similarity\n: computing similarities among all imported projects by using the star events and project dependencies;\n\n\nDependency Similarity\n: using the Jaccard distance on project dependencies to calculate the similarity between two projects;\n\n\nCrossRec Similarity\n: a lightweight version of CrossSim. It uses project dependencies to provide similarities among all imported projects;\n\n\nReadme Similarity\n: The similarity between a project p1 and a project p2 is calculated as the similarity between their readme files with the corresponding features\n\n\nRepoPalCompound Similarity\n: being inspired by the approach presented in [];\n\n\nRepoPalCompoundV2 Similarity\n: an evolved version of RepoPalCompound similarity;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRepoPalCompound\n method provides, in this case, the most accurate result suggesting a set of libraries dealing with JSON. Select the library \njackson-databind\n.\n\n\n\nAt this point, you can either import this library as an Eclipse project (see at the previous task) or you can import it as a Maven dependency.\n\n\nImport it as an Eclipse project\n\n\nPlease look at previous task.\n\n\nImport it as a Maven dependency\n\n\nThe GitHub readme file suggests how to import Jackson-core library as a Maven dependency (the GitHub page link is available in the details view of the project). \n\n\n\n\nConvert the example against the new library\n\n\nIn this particular case, we could use the readme file of this library because it provides some good examples which can be used to convert the previous example against the Jackson-core library.

However, only the password protected sources require the additional paramenters.\n\n\nDates preceeding the current date are processed once because the reader does not keep track of the website evolution up to the current date.\n\n\nThe reader assumes that all textual information within the specified URL location are related to documentation.\n\n\nThe crawler is configured to comply with the Robots Exclusion protocol and thus follows the rules in the robots.txt file during crawling.\n\n\nThe crawler does not support websites that are based mostly on JavaScript, such as websites based on AngularJS. The reason behind is that the crawler cannot execute JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\nBack to top",

By default the value is zero, which means that the documentation will be retrieved only once at the beginning of the analysis.

For clarity, all examples used in the above table are derived from the Eclipse Foundation website. For example, the  username  field is defined as name.  The  Documentation Systematic  reader supports both password protected and un-protected sources.  URL  and  ExecutionFrequency  are mandatory for both sources. However, only the password protected sources require the additional paramenters.  Dates preceeding the current date are processed once because the reader does not keep track of the website evolution up to the current date.  The reader assumes that all textual information within the specified URL location are related to documentation.  The crawler is configured to comply with the Robots Exclusion protocol and thus follows the rules in the robots.txt file during crawling.  The crawler does not support websites that are based mostly on JavaScript, such as websites based on AngularJS. The reason behind is that the crawler cannot execute JavaScript.   Back to top",
